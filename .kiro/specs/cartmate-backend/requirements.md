# CartMate Backend Requirements Document

## Introduction

CartMate is an AI-powered shopping assistant that uses Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol for intelligent agent communication. The backend serves as a conversational shopping platform that integrates with Online Boutique microservices to provide personalized shopping experiences through style analysis, product discovery, price comparison, and cart management.

The system follows a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents handle different aspects of the shopping experience, coordinated through an orchestrator agent using the A2A protocol for seamless communication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Orchestrator Agent

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a conversational AI shopping assistant that understands my requests and coordinates appropriate responses, so that I can have natural shopping conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a chat message THEN the system SHALL route the message to the orchestrator agent
2. WHEN the orchestrator receives a message THEN it SHALL analyze the intent using Vertex AI Gemini
3. WHEN intent analysis is complete THEN the orchestrator SHALL determine which specialized agents to engage
4. WHEN multiple agents are needed THEN the orchestrator SHALL coordinate their responses using A2A protocol
5. WHEN agent responses are received THEN the orchestrator SHALL synthesize a coherent response to the user
6. WHEN conversation context is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain session state across interactions
7. WHEN processing complex requests THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide streaming partial responses showing its reasoning process
8. WHEN delegating to other agents THEN the orchestrator SHALL inform users about which agent is being consulted and why

### Requirement 2: WebSocket Communication Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time communication with the shopping assistant, so that I can have fluid conversations without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the chat interface THEN the system SHALL establish a WebSocket connection
2. WHEN a WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL create a unique session identifier
3. WHEN messages are sent via WebSocket THEN they SHALL be processed in real-time
4. WHEN responses are ready THEN they SHALL be sent immediately via the WebSocket connection
5. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection
6. WHEN session expires THEN the system SHALL clean up associated resources

### Requirement 3: A2A Protocol Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want agents to communicate efficiently using standardized protocols, so that the system is scalable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need to communicate THEN they SHALL use the A2A protocol format
2. WHEN an agent starts THEN it SHALL register itself with the A2A coordinator
3. WHEN agent discovery is requested THEN the system SHALL provide available agent capabilities
4. WHEN messages are sent between agents THEN they SHALL include proper context and metadata
5. WHEN message routing is needed THEN the A2A coordinator SHALL handle delivery
6. WHEN agents are unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle graceful degradation

### Requirement 4: Style Profiler Agent

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload images of clothing or outfits to help the system understand my style preferences, so that I receive personalized product recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the style profiler agent SHALL analyze it using Vertex AI Vision
2. WHEN image analysis is complete THEN the agent SHALL extract style elements (colors, patterns, cuts, brands)
3. WHEN style elements are identified THEN the agent SHALL categorize the user's aesthetic preferences
4. WHEN multiple images are analyzed THEN the agent SHALL build a comprehensive style profile
5. WHEN style profile is updated THEN it SHALL be stored for future personalization
6. WHEN style analysis fails THEN the agent SHALL provide helpful feedback to the user

### Requirement 5: Product Discovery Agent

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for products that match my style and preferences, so that I can find items I'm likely to purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests product search THEN the agent SHALL query the Online Boutique Product Catalog Service
2. WHEN style profile exists THEN the agent SHALL use it to personalize search results
3. WHEN products are found THEN they SHALL be ranked by style compatibility
4. WHEN no exact matches exist THEN the agent SHALL suggest similar alternatives
5. WHEN inventory is checked THEN only available products SHALL be returned
6. WHEN search fails THEN the agent SHALL provide alternative search suggestions

### Requirement 6: Price Comparison Agent

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see competitive pricing information for products I'm interested in, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a product is selected THEN the price comparison agent SHALL search external retailers using Perplexity API
2. WHEN price data is found THEN it SHALL be compared with Online Boutique pricing
3. WHEN better deals are available THEN they SHALL be presented to the user
4. WHEN price alerts are requested THEN the system SHALL monitor for price changes
5. WHEN external API fails THEN the agent SHALL gracefully handle the error
6. WHEN no external prices are found THEN the agent SHALL indicate Online Boutique exclusivity

### Requirement 7: Cart Management Agent

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my shopping cart through conversation, so that I can add, remove, and modify items naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to add items THEN the cart agent SHALL integrate with Online Boutique Cart Service
2. WHEN items are added THEN the agent SHALL validate style coherence with existing cart items
3. WHEN cart modifications are requested THEN they SHALL be processed immediately
4. WHEN cart state changes THEN it SHALL be persisted across sessions
5. WHEN style conflicts exist THEN the agent SHALL suggest alternatives or modifications
6. WHEN cart operations fail THEN the agent SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 8: Session and Profile Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my preferences and cart to be remembered across sessions, so that I can continue shopping where I left off.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a session THEN the system SHALL load their existing profile and cart state
2. WHEN profile data is updated THEN it SHALL be stored in Redis for fast access
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN data SHALL be persisted for future retrieval
4. WHEN user preferences change THEN the profile SHALL be updated accordingly
5. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL handle graceful recovery
6. WHEN privacy is requested THEN user data SHALL be properly anonymized or deleted

### Requirement 9: External Service Integration
