# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CartMate Plus is an AI-powered shopping assistant frontend that simulates a crew of specialized AI agents working together to enhance the online shopping experience. The application will feature a React-based chat interface where users interact with different AI agents, each with distinct personalities and roles. Initially, the system will use mock data to simulate the multi-agent interactions and shopping functionality, with a future backend integration planned to connect with Google's Online Boutique services.
